Did you find the AI-generated content engaging and playable?
i think the background is interesting and playable at the same time because there is a lot of randomness in this game
How well did the AI follow general board game rules (e.g., fairness, balance)?
the balance is also good because it takes me more than 10 minutes to finish the game and randomly drawing points ensures continuity and fairness
Does the AI provided useful suggestions and does it met your creative needs?
the suggestions themselves feel less effective than your own musings
When does the AI fell short or produced invalid outputs?
haven't encountered many ineffective output situations
