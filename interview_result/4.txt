Please answer the following questions:
Did you find the AI-generated content engaging and playable?
Yes, it appears engaging and playable. The mechanics are clear and offer a mix of strategy (resource management, area control) and player interaction (negotiation, trading). The dynamic market pricing and character abilities add depth.

How well did the AI follow general board game rules (e.g., fairness, balance)?
It was well.
The mechanics are consistent, and fairness is maintained through clear requirements for actions (e.g., trading, worker placement). However, not sure if any character ability or strategy disproportionately affects outcomes.

Does the AI provided useful suggestions and does it met your creative needs?
The rules for resolving deadlocks in negotiations are unclear. The resource price fluctuations seems realistic but the price stabilize sometimes too quick.
When does the AI fell short or produced invalid outputs?
